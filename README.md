# Hanksenberg Chingu Solo Project - Tier 1 - eCalendar

![demo of tier 1 site](./assets/demo.gif) 

## Overview 

This project is a great opportunity to help me develop a clean and modern webpage. The *eCalendar* app will be completed across tiers, with each tier adding a new level of complexity. I am currently on the **Tier 1 repo**, which means I am responsible for coding the **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to get the structure, styling, and some basic functionality up and running.

**No Frameworks, Libraries, or Code Generators May Be Used In This Tier**

## Instructions

This project is completed with **vanilla** (plain) HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Do not use front-end frameworks or libraries *(JQuery, Bootstrap, etc.)*.

General instructions for all Pre-Work Projects can also be found in the Chingu Voyage Handbook (URL posted in the #read-me-first channel on Discord).

 ```

*Functionality*

*Upon Load:*

- [x] A div will highlight the present day of the month as well as the current weekdate of the month (ex:// on Tuesday the 19th, both *Tues above the calendar dates and the 19th* will have special styling to indicate the present date!)
- [x] All other corresponding theming will match the correct dates according to their place in the week

- [x] Have modal displayed as shown in the demo. This form is **not** expected to be functional.
- [x] Is hidden when not in use


*Other:*
