# Chingu Solo Project - Tier 1 - eCalendar

![demo of tier 1 site](./assets/demo.gif) 

## Overview 

This project is a great opportunity to develop a clean and modern webpage. The *eCalendar* app will be completed across tiers, with each tier adding a new level of complexity. You are currently on the **Tier 1 repo**. You'll be responsible for coding the **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to get the structure, styling, and some basic functionality up and running.

As you add skills to your developer toolbag you'll be able to come back to this project and add in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 features. Ultimately you'll have a great portfolio piece, and will have implemented a number of common and in-demand features.

**No Frameworks, Libraries, or Code Generators May Be Used In This Tier**
